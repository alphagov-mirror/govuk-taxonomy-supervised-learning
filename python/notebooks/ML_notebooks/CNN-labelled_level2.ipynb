       "      <th>keeping britain safe from cyber attacks: matt hancock speech the minister for cabinet office gave a speech on the uk's cyber security strategy and keeping britain safe from cyber attacks. i’m very grateful to the telegraph for asking me here to this crucial conference on cyber security. as we’re guests of the telegraph i want to start with a little story about the telegraph. not the paper but the technology. a century ago the first world war was raging in europe and the allies were desperate to bring america into the war on our side. then in january 1917 the german ambassador to mexico received an encrypted telegram from berlin. it instructed him to offer the mexican government money and diplomatic support for an audacious invasion of the united states. but this message was subject to one of the first and perhaps most influential cyber security breaches in history. it didn’t matter that the idea was half-baked that the mexicans had no interest in invading arizona. when the contents were revealed american opinion was outraged. shortly after congress voted to join the war. so why did the german high command entrust such a sensitive message to western union then as now a wire transfer company? because they had failed to appreciate an obvious network vulnerability. the subsea cable they were using did not travel directly from europe. instead it went through britain stopping off at land’s end where the signal was boosted before being transmitted to america. this meant it very easy for british naval intelligence to listen in on the traffic. once war broke out any diplomatic telegrams passing through were copied down and dispatched to room 40 the forerunner of gchq. i mention this story as a warning against complacency. telegraphy was the email of its day: trusted and widely used familiar rather than cutting edge. people thought it was secure but it wasn’t. a hundred years on our trusted communications are wireless instantaneous and virtually cost-free. data is stored in the cloud not in filing cabinets. and this has changed the world beyond all recognition in my view emphatically for the better. vulnerability in cyber security from the little to the life-changing remote robotic surgery to online box-sets. we are freer more prosperous more knowledgeable about the world than ever before. yet this brings with it renewed vulnerability. barriers to entry have come crashing down for companies and cyber-criminals alike. unlike in 1917 you don’t need to be a state to inflict a massive data breach. when peoples’ cyber security isn’t up to scratch you just need a laptop and an internet connection. the tech may have got smarter but the biggest weakness in any system is still the human being. in the last year 2 thirds of large businesses in the uk experienced an cyber attack. almost a quarter suffered a breach at least once a month. this matters because we are one of the world’s leading digital nations. twelve and a half per cent of our economy is now online. no other country does more e-commerce. in government too we’ve begun to upload the state using technology to build more responsive user-centric public services. i call it the smartphone state. and we’re still only in the foothills. smart energy networked cities quantum computing: these all have the potential to transform our lives and refashion our economy. but to deliver on that promise we have to be able to defend our digital society from those who wish it and us harm. a strong cyber defence requires three things. first we – industry and government – together must recognise that this is a shared responsibility a duty that we owe our fellow citizens. second that we deliver on that commitment by equipping them with the right skills. and third that we can and must turn our vulnerabilities into a source of economic strength. let me take each in turn. shared responsibility first it’s vital to recognise this is an issue for ceos as well as spooks. the vast majority of the uk’s critical national infrastructure is operated by the private sector. power water and telecoms are all critical targets. even outside that our digital lives are in your hands everything from our life savings to our holiday snaps. i’m encouraged to see that two thirds of businesses say cyber security is now a priority for senior managers. yet there remains a gap between awareness and action. only half of the businesses we surveyed this year have taken steps to identify cyber risks. make no mistake the next data breach will happen. it’s your duty to make it’s not your company splashed across the papers when it does. but we don’t expect you to do it alone. we’ve created the uk’s first systematic national cyber security programme and we’re almost doubling the funding with £1.9 billion over the next five years. we’re setting up a national cyber security centre under gchq. the centre will provide a single point of contact for businesses in need of advice and support. i want it to become a hub of world-class user-friendly expertise: a global leader under the steady hand of ciaran martin bridging the gap between the worlds of government and industry. and today i’m publishing the centre’s prospectus setting out how it’ll work ahead of its full launch later this year. and we want to hear from you what you think and how it can help your business. i strongly recommend that you feed back to us so we can design the national cyber security centre around your needs. the right skills we already know that your number one need is for skills and this is the second part of facing down the cyber threat. it’s not just that we need more skills. computer security needs to become a basic life skill like learning to drive. and while we want everyone to pass the test we also need our elite formula 1 drivers. so we’re growing the talent pool at every stage of the education system. learning coding in schools competitions to get more girls into cyber residential courses for students in years 12 and 13 - sponsorship for the most promising undergrads – all under the government-backed cyber first banner. we’ve opened new routes into cyber security like the new trailblazer apprenticeship. and i’m proud to give my support to the new extended project qualification which the cyber security challenge just created. this level 3 qualification equivalent to an as level teaches the basics of cyber security in three months and can be studied in schools colleges or through the challenge itself. but industry has to play its part too. we need more businesses to offer training sponsorship apprenticeships: more breaks for the best minds. because if we commit now together the struggle in cyberspace is britain’s opportunity. that’s the third part of securing our cyber defences: not just protecting the digital economy but growing it. turning risk into reward we’re already one of the top 5 exporters in the world and the global market is growing by 20% a year. a strong cyber security industry means a safer britain. so we’re funding test labs where cyber start-ups can refine their prototypes: a cyber security fund to scale the established players a cyber security innovation centre in cheltenham. and today i can announce a new cyber security trade champion for the gulf to help uk companies win business in the region while supporting the work of the uk cyber ambassador. this comes alongside our dedicated cyber specialist in washington who’s been supporting our engagement with cyber businesses in the us. our goal is to create a commercial ecosystem where cutting-edge research is backed start-ups get scaled and british companies win business around the world. conclusion so shared responsibility the right skills and boosting the cyber economy: get these 3 right and we can get across this challenge. everyone has their part to play to close the chinks in our armour and the gaps in our capability. there is no doubt that cyber attacks are a serious and growing problem. but the history of technological advance - and with it of human progress - is the history of solving problems. after the first world war the germans determined that their codes would never again be cracked built mechanical encryption machines. in turn we built the world’s first digital computers to break them. we can’t know what we’ll evolve in response to the current threat. but if we are honest about the threat if we work together we can drive progress power innovation build better tech and a safer more prosperous britain. that is our task and i look forward to working with you to achieve it.</th>\n",

       "      <th>business secretary: more must be done to ensure bme workers get more job opportunities business secretary sajid javid has said that businesses must do more to help bme workers access the labour market. businesses must do more to help bme workers access the labour market and progress their careers business secretary sajid javid said yesterday (8 march 2016) at the first meeting of a new cross-whitehall ministerial taskforce when he called on them to engage with baroness mcgregor-smith’s review into access to the labour market. ministers from across government met to discuss the barriers to progress and agree what more could be done to deliver the pm ’s bme 2020 vision which set out a series of targets. the meeting came as department for work and pensions ( dwp ) released a breakdown of the current scale of the problem faced by those from bme backgrounds when looking for work. according to latest ons statistics the annual bme employment rate was 62.7% almost 13 percentage points lower than the white employment rate of 75.4%. alongside this the employment rate for people of pakistani or bangladeshi ethnic origin was 55% around 20 percentage points lower than the employment rate for people from white ethnic groups – while it stood at 63.9% for people of black ethnic origin. dwp are already looking to tackle bme unemployment by working with jobcentres to identify and share best practice in working with bme groups. baroness ruby mcgregor-smith’s review the terms of reference for which were published yesterday specifically focuses on identifying and tackling the obstacles which prevent these groups from succeeding. business secretary sajid javid said: a good deal of work has already been done across government to improve opportunities for people from bme backgrounds. but while we have seen progress in many areas these troubling figures highlight just how difficult it can be to find a job if you’re from a minority background. this is why i am determined to ensure this new ministerial taskforce will drive positive change to support bme workers to find the opportunities they need to fulfil their potential. according to business in the community research 1 in 10 employed people come from a bme background yet only 1 in 16 of top management positions and 1 in 13 management positions were held from people from these groups. this is despite independent research undertaken by mckinsey showing that companies with the highest rates of ethnic diversity in senior management were 35% more likely to outperform their industry counterparts. employment minister priti patel said: the uk employment rate for bme groups is currently the highest since records began 15 years ago. but we know there is more to do which is why this government is committed to increasing the overall bme employment level and apprenticeship take-up by 20% by 2020. this is a challenge that government business and communities must meet to ensure that every part of britain can benefit from our growing economy. the terms of reference for baroness mcgregor-smith’s review which will specifically look to address these issues will look at: the imperative for change: the impact on the uk economy as a whole of having more bme people represented at every level of the workforce identifying the obstacles: the obstacles bme people face and whether these differ across groups and at different stages of an individual’s career assessing the impacts: the impact of these obstacles on both the individual and the labour market as a whole gathering the data: consider what data exists how businesses currently use it and whether more can be done to use this data in developing successful interventions highlighting what works: collect examples of best practice from across the uk and look to share the key lessons more broadly baroness mcgregor-smith said: i am delighted to be leading this review. it has never been more important to fully capitalise on the skills and talents of every individual in the workplace regardless of their background. we need to remove the barriers that for so long have restricted bme talent from reaching the most senior levels in business. these actions will deliver long-term economic benefits for the uk. notes to editors: the meeting is part of the government’s ambitious bme 2020 plan and is aimed at improving labour market outcomes for those from bme backgrounds. ministers from across government have been charged with: increasing the proportion of apprenticeships taken up by young people from bme backgrounds by 20% increasing the number of bme students going to university by 20% ensuring that 20 000 start-up loans are awarded to bme applicants by 2020 increasing bme employment by 20% by 2020 increasing the diversity of the armed forces increasing the diversity of police recruitment latest ons quarterly figures are available at labour market status by ethnic group: a09 . figures quoted are 4-quarter averages of the latest ons quarterly statistics from october to december 2015. the latest figure is the highest 4-quarter average on a comparable basis since the current series began in

       "      <th>social investment for better public services bringing together individuals with the influence and expertise to tackle britain’s most damaging social problems. it is a pleasure to be here. represented in this room are all of whitehall’s largest departments alongside local government businesses charities and many others. indeed today’s conference is all about bringing together individuals with the influence and expertise to tackle britain’s most damaging social problems. asking how we can do better and do more when it comes to bringing life change to those most in need. meaningful change yet even to start with this question gets us straight to the point of social investment – for how often have we heard the refrain: “government ought to do something”. too often in the past this has been the classic and irresistible invitation to politicians to take action. money is found a programme is invented and – well that’s the point. doing something has seldom been the same as solving something. despite good intentions it cannot be enough to pour money into social programmes but with too little care for results the other end. no – what matters most is the impact our actions have in transforming people’s prospects restoring security hope and independence so that all in our society have a chance to prosper. as you delve into the detail today i would ask that you hold this thought: that social investment holds the promise of another way. not spending money and hoping for the best but instead securing a return on investment whereby every pound we spend goes on meaningful change making a measurable difference to people’s lives. return on investment this is the latent potential of social investment which to my mind stands to make perhaps the single most significant difference to how we fund and deliver social services in years to come. transforming what has historically been government’s role: to pick up the pieces of social breakdown – through our welfare health justice systems and so on. all of us here shoulder that responsibility and all of us know that it comes at a cost. take for example supporting a child in care – estimated to cost £60 000 a year. the cost of keeping a first-time young offender in jail – over £20 000. the cost of someone sitting on jobseeking benefits for a year – £10 000. £90 000 – for just one life that goes off course. so we have always known the price of failure. the question is can we value change? social return imagine if we were to realise that positive change comes with a real value as well – as individuals become productive members of society moving from dependence on the state to independence. whether it is helping someone into work off the streets through rehabilitation into adoption any one of these outcomes and countless others comes with a clear social return. but also a financial one as we pay out less in costly remedial interventions. herein lies the key to social investment in turn transforming the whole culture of public spending. harnessing social investment any of us – from central government and councils to social enterprises and charities – can stop paying for process of tackling social problems and start focussing instead on the results that we achieve. world leader over the last 5 years the uk has become a world leader in putting these principles into practice. having established the g8 social investment taskforce now others from across the globe – america germany canada france and more – are looking to us for leadership and innovation. one game-changer has been big society capital the world’s first financial institution dedicated to impact investment. together with the first social stock exchange established in london. we have also introduced the world’s first tax relief on social investment – which could generate up to nearly £500 million over the next 5 years. all of this has put the uk in the lead in terms of infrastructure: on the one hand leveraging private money to support burgeoning social enterprises and social entrepreneurs and on the other helping new start-ups and ventures to build their capacity and become investment-ready. as a result the uk’s social investment market is now one of the fastest-growing in the world. social impact bonds but perhaps the one area where the uk has made most progress of all is in the government’s development of social impact bonds. this works on the basis of government monetising the value of a given positive outcome and underwriting the return – creating a bond into which others invest. if the programme delivers the outcomes investors see a return whilst government pays not for the process of tackling the problem but for success at the other end. having pooled £70 million across government to fund these outcomes the coalition has now established more social impact bonds than the rest of the world put together – moving from one operational bond to 31. take for example the 10 projects financed by my department’s £30 million innovation fund which i set up 4 years ago. this has proved the concept with cutting-edge programmes such as knife crime prevention and remedial education to improve the prospects of our most disadvantaged young people. already we are seeing these bonds develop a meaningful track record could be replicated on a national or even international basis. the innovation fund has generated 16 000 positive educational and employment outcomes for young people. so too the rough sleeping bond in london which has reduced rough sleeping by 30%. and in the original peterborough prison bond for the first thousand short sentence prisoners reoffending was reduced by 8.4%. youth engagement fund it is off the back of this success that we have established a new £16 million youth engagement fund helping a further 8 000 young people by preventing the scarring and entrenched problems that come with falling out of school or work altogether. today i am very pleased to announce the 4 successful bidders who will be taking forward new social impact bonds: unlocking potential in greater merseyside prevista in london futureshapers in sheffield teens and toddlers youth engagement in greater manchester these projects are the first centrally-funded bonds that have also sought a local contribution to outcomes – in this case from councils and schools – a starting point for the collaboration and co-commissioning that local government has been leading through community budgets. together with projects catalysed through the government’s £20 million social outcomes fund today this brings us to a total of 7 new social impact bonds reaching over 18 000 disadvantaged people. from assisting those with mental illness into work supporting people with long-term health conditions and helping children in care – 3 of the newest projects are focussed on some of britain’s most vulnerable individuals of all. proving the effectiveness of social impact bonds in tackling the most pressing and complex social problems that we face. industrial scale now the challenge remains for government to scale up social investment – harnessing it in the design commissioning and delivery of many more of our social services. in doing so the first step is to build an evidence base – creating certainty around the return for investors. that is why the government has developed a whole network of centres such as the early intervention foundation which now assess accredit and advise on what works. and it is why i am pleased that we are doing more to measure the impact of different interventions – building on the pioneering work of new philanthropy capital in developing in a datalab with the ministry of justice – now testing the same concept with the department for work and pensions for an employment datalab too. by opening up much more of the government’s data to providers charities and social ventures all of us can better understand the outcomes of what we do on the frontline – proving its effectiveness. yet if we are serious about exponential growth in social investment then i believe what is really needed is a multi-million or even billion pound government commitment – creating a far greater social impact fund to pay for proven outcomes. it is this that would take social impact bonds to an industrial scale. fidelity guarantee with it that money brings rigour discipline and innovation – historically the preserve of the private sector – brought to bear on our most complex social challenges. yet even more than that the social investment model also bring what i call the ‘fidelity guarantee’: an assurance that what you pay for ‘does exactly what it says on the tin’. this value of this guarantee cannot be underestimated. for it stops what has so often been the downfall of social programmes in the past – that in implementing a programme that is proven to work it ends up being modified – tinkered with to the extent that the programme you started with isn’t actually delivered. with social impact bond on the other hand if the project ends up being changed no results mean no pay-out. by design then social investment stands to save money historically wasted on underperforming projects by ensuring that what works is delivered properly. but what’s more social investment shores up government finances because the whole premise is of a return linked to a given outcome. every pound for life change – that is the opportunity of a lifetime. the first trillion without doubt there is still much more to do if we are to realise the full benefit of what remains a nascent market. our ambition must be pitched higher aiming to catalyse the next wave of social investment. not just a more effective use of taxpayers’ money but actually growing the money available for social programmes beyond government or philanthropy alone. this is about unleashing investment from businesses trust funds entrepreneurs and more – groups who might never before have seen themselves as part of the solution for social change. take the fact that uk asset managers look after around £3 trillion. of this and other private funds the g8 social investment taskforce has already identified the ‘first trillion’ of potential investment money. £1 trillion – that’s what it cost to deliver our health and education systems for the last 5 years. it’s 135 times the estimated rise in costs for local public services over the next 5 years. so far from thinking that budget pressures and rising costs are insurmountable just think what that money could mean on the ground – how many people it could help how many lives it could transform. as i look around and see so many faces from local government i say this is true particularly for councils. as we look to the future social investment could mean the end of going cap in hand to central government reliant on uncertain short-term grants. thus it is vital that we bring social investment into the mainstream – making it the norm for corporate social responsibility in the private sector for asset managers investment banks and many more getting sustainable funding flowing to where it will have the most impact. reuniting society if we can get this right i believe the effect social investment could have is dramatic – not just in fiscal terms but in terms of our society as well. for too long a disparity has prevailed between the top and bottom of our society. we have a group of wealth creators at the top who have little or no connection to those at the bottom. yet through social investment we have an opportunity to lock not just wealth back into our most disadvantaged areas – but something else as well. just imagine a social enterprise working in a particular deprived neighbourhood – be it in london or birmingham glasgow or leeds. investors buy into it and as with any investment will want to see it flourish. because they are risking their money – money that could otherwise be reaping a return elsewhere – those investors will want to see that social programme succeed taking an interest in that community where they would otherwise be totally detached brought back into contact with our most disadvantaged individuals and families for mutual benefit. for too often what is lacking in these areas is not just money but hope and aspiration – the belief that the cycle of poverty can be broken. thus these wealth creators could have a powerful influence on the communities themselves a human interface between 2 polarised worlds and 2 groups often separated by only a different start in life. bringing success to the doorstep of failure and 2 ends of our society closer together – reuniting the city and the inner city. conclusion now is the time to seize this opportunity. above all it lies in the hands of all of you here today. for this is not an agenda about politics or politicians. rather the complete opposite is true. politics aside the future of social investment lies with local authorities commissioners and policy-makers. with a real chance for you to drive innovation encourage entrepreneurship and invest intelligently. for in straightened times and faced with tight budgets all of us need to find new ways of tackling social problems answering a call to action in the years to come. social investment offers a way forward ensuring that each and every pound we spend has a demonstrable purpose – transforming the lives of people now and the chances of future generations. restoring our finances as we are compelled to do – but most of all restoring cohesion to our society and restoring hope and aspiration to those on the margins – at the same time restoring lives.</th>\n",

       "      <th>freeze-frame premiere: bringing the uk and china closer together in film on 1 december deputy head of mission andrew key hosted the premiere of first ever british embassy great film project freeze-frame. attended by lead actress tian yuan british director anthony fabian and executive producer carter pilcher the screening event brought together over 100 british and chinese creative industry and media guests to celebrate the release of the film. available to watch online film fans in china are in for a special treat with this film created especially for the inaugural great british online film festival. launched in october on leading online video portal letv the festival is running for two months and features more than 50 top british features and short films. the films are all available to watch for free at www.filmisgreat.cn (a mandarin and english website). freeze-frame is a creative collaboration between the uk government’s great campaign and virgin atlantic airways. produced by shortstv and directed by award-winner anthony fabian freeze-frame is a 17-minute romantic comedy taking audiences on a voyage to london edinburgh and shanghai. the film stars award-winning chinese actress tian yuan and british rising star freddie fox. executive producer carter pilcher tian yuan and british director anthony fabian (from left to right) director anthony fabian commented: with freeze-frame we are planting a small seed which we hope will grow and proliferate into a mighty forest of collaboration between the british and chinese film industries. great stories can be found everywhere so my approach to filmmaking has always been very international; any project that helps foster greater understanding between different cultures such as this one is immediately appealing to me. it’s also been a joy to discover and work with the exceptionally talented tian yuan whom i didn’t know prior to making this film. tian yuan plays a daring young woman chen fei on a top secret mission that takes her halfway across the world in order to honour a promise. not afraid to bend the rules and determined to succeed fei runs into unexpected troubles that require her to play detective and secretly chase the handsome stranger she meets on a plane. in recognition of her contribution to the uk-china creative partnership tian yuan was named ‘great britain on screen’ image ambassador at the launch of the great british online film festival on 9th october by british ambassador to china sir sebastian wood. tian yuan said: i love british film myself being both an actor and director. my experience of shooting freeze frame in the uk was unforgettable and i greatly valued this chance to admire the beautiful scenery and work alongside top british film talent. as image ambassador i hope that in the future i can continue to promote and encourage cooperation in film between china and the uk. freeze-frame showcases the uk’s world-leading film talents both behind and in front of the camera to new audiences across china. the film also references some of the uk’s most famous productions in the story. freddie fox’s character jack take audiences to a succession of famous british locations as featured in films such as harry potter downton abbey and love actually. the film also intends to inspire chinese netizens to travel to the uk and experience these iconic locations for themselves. film – and increasingly television – is a growing driver of tourism to britain. when daniel craig and judi dench as james bond and m stood surveying the lush landscape of glencoe millions of cinemagoers admired it too – and the mountain has since seen an increase of more than 40% in visitors. when harry potter dipped and dived on his broomstick at his first quidditch lesson alnwick castle played the role of hogwarts – and saw an increase in visitors of 230% boosting the local economy by an extra £9million; the castle now even hosts quidditch lessons for visitors. visitbritain research indicates that 40% of potential visitors would be “very likely” to visit places they’ve seen in films or on tv which now accounts for nearly 10% of all tourism. in april this year the sino-uk film co-production treaty was signed in beijing sparking the creation of a series of cross-cultural projects to mark the new partnerships between the two nations in producing creative quality film. to develop this opportunity further the ‘great britain on screen’ campaign has run through 2014 and into next year promoting the best of uk film and tv to fans and industry professionals across the country. carter pilcher chief executive of shortstv the producers of freeze-frame said: we’re delighted to be teaming up with the great campaign and virgin atlantic airways to bring something very special to chinese audiences that no one has ever done before. we think freeze-frame will really blow audiences away and hope that it will serve as an example that jumpstarts the chinese and british filmmaking cooperation. tune in to the great british online film festival to watch freeze-frame and other british films at www.filmisgreat.cn !</th>\n",
